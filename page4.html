                <h2>Goals And Dreams</h2>
                <p>When it comes to aspirations, I believe that most goals of mine can be somewhat basic. I'd love to<br>
                    travel the world, aquire a job, become successful, etc. However, when thinking about my future and, <br>
                    my future career, I would like to become a web developer because I would like to contribute to the one <br>
                    thing that's been constant all my life, and that has been the internet. When visiting websites and <br>
                    interacting with them, I have ideas of my own that I would like to apply to these websites and visions <br>
                    of how I would create a website of my own. I would also like to learn about what it takes to maintain <br>
                    these websites, as there's lots of detail and careful planning that goes into it. I hope I can learn <br>
                    these skills and would like to apply them in the real world.
