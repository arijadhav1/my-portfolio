                <h2> What I Like To Do</h2>
                <p> When I'm not working or have some extra free time, I like to spend time outside and just <br>
                    enjoy nature. You can find me usually biking everyday during evenings or even walking for <br>
                    fitness. I really enjoy hikes and just being surrounded by nature, and can spend hours on <br>
                    a hike if possible. I also really enjoy fishing, as it's a hobby I've had since I was a little<br>
                    kid when my dad used to take me out for fishing. I also take time to watch videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube <br></a> from time to time. Other than that, I always look forward to
                    meeting up with my friends <br>and play some sports or going to new places.
